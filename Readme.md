# Plinko Game

## Overview

This is a simple **Plinko Game** built using **HTML**, **CSS**, **Node.js**, and **React**. The game simulates the classic Plinko board from game shows, where a ball is dropped from the top and bounces through pegs until it lands in a scoring slot at the bottom.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The game board adjusts to different screen sizes using CSS.
- **Random Ball Physics**: The ball interacts with pegs on the board in a randomized fashion, creating a unique path each time.
- **Score Calculation**: Players are awarded points based on where the ball lands.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with React to provide a dynamic, interactive experience.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: For structuring the game board and UI.
- **CSS**: For styling the game and creating animations.
- **Node.js**: Backend server handling (if needed for additional features like multiplayer or scoring storage).
- **React**: Frontend framework used for building the user interface and game logic.
